Bootfinds

## About the app

We all have items we don't really need at home. But due to the current circumstances we can't sell them at the flea market. 
Also to have the spot at the fleamarket will cost you some money and you will have to be there for a few hours to sell. 
Let's post the items to the app and sell the items from home.
